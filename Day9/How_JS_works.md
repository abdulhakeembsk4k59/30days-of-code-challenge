How does JavaScript Work?
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and one of the most efficient, commonly used scripting languages. The term .client-side scripting language means that it runs at the client-side( or on the client machine) inside the web-browsers, but one important thing to remember is that client's web-browser also needs to support the JavaScript or it must be JavaScript enabled. Nowadays, most of the modern web browsers support JavaScript and have their JavaScript engines. For example, Google Chrome has its own JavaScript engine called V8.
